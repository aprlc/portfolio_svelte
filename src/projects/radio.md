_onoffon radio_ is a handmade, micro-radio not bounded by location, audience, or contributors. Sometimes on, sometimes off, the radio holds space for discussion, casual publishing, knowledge sharing, audio-making, and sonic experimentation.

This project includes a manual to build your own online radio using free, libre open source software hosted on a Raspberry Pi (a small computer). The intention was to open up making and maintaining media infrastructure to realms outside of industrial/ commercial making. What happens when we can build our own means of communing online? Who will you invite to gather?
