MORE LOVE is a private display of affection on the Internet. Made with love with P5.js and Teachable Machine, MORE LOVE translates gestures into virtual love messages. A webpiece to think about quieter and more loving interactions on the Internet.

Exhibited at the UAL Creative Computing Showcase. Originally a 2-channel interactive installation, consolidated into a web piece.
